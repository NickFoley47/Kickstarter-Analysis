# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We conducted an analysis on Kickstarter data to help Louise improve her chances of being successful with her project campaign. We analyzed quantitative data to find if they were patterns, correlations, disadvantages, advantages, and many other factors that could either help Louise or harm her Kickstarter project. This allowed us to help determine the best data guided path to success for Louise.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Looking at the graph we constructed based on months of the year, we can determine which months have given Kickstarters the greatest success. Based on our data we can determine the most successful month would be May which has 111 successful campaigns. May has a success rate of 67% which would be the best month for Louise to launch her campaign. 
The next best month would be June which has 100 successful campaigns. June has a 65% success rate which is 2% less than May but still offers a higher success rate than other months. A month Louise should avoid is December due to 35 failed campaigns and only having 37 successful campaigns. That is a 49% success rate compared to May which has a 67% and June has a 65% success rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the graph we constructed on Outcomes based on goals, we can infer a couple of goals that Louise should stay in for to be successful. According to our data less than $1,000 through $5,000 to $9,999 have the greatest success. The success ranges from 76% to 55% in that data range. As the goal increases, we can see that the percentage of the outcome being successful decreases. Louise is asking for $12,000 for her play. She will need to reduce her initial goal to raise her success percentage.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One challenge is not knowing how much effort each Kickstarter team put into raising money to reach their goal. For instance, some of the failed campaigns could be due to people being lazy and not actively reaching out to peers for donations. Another one could be asking for donations near holidays. When holidays come around people are usually already spending a lot of money. For example, if you ask for donations in December, the kickstarter would not get as much due to Christmas being in December. 
  
Another challenge would be realistic goals for a Kickstarter. A Kickstarter organizer could set an unrealistic goal for the campaign. In our data for the play “Comedy Of Errors: Antioch Community High School” that Kickstarter set a goal of $20,000 and only received a $453 pledge in total. This failed campaign could have set an unrealistic goal for themselves. If you look at their timeline of their campaign, they only had less than a month to pledge $20,000.  Another campaign, “Eyes Closed - The First In-Dream Theater Experience”, was able to get a pledge amount of $20,000 in that timeline, but that is another challenge to analyze because as stated before we do not know how much of an effort the Kickstarter team put into the campaign. 
## Results

One conclusion we can draw from our data is that the most successful month for a Kickstarter to begin is May. May has an 67% success rate which is the highest success rate from our data set. June is the next highest with an 65% chance of success. 
Another conclusion we can draw is that January, March, September, November, and December are some of the worst months to start a Kickstart. December has a 49% success rate which is because of the holidays in December/January people are not willing to pledged as much as other months. 

According to our data set, having a goal in the range of less than $9,999 shows Kickstarters having the highest percentage of success. Louise had a goal of $12,000 which in our data shows a 54% success rate. $5,000 to $9,999 has a 55% chance of success which is only a 1% difference between them. Louise’s goal is in a great range, and she has a higher chance of getting the goal she needs. 

A limitation of this data set is knowing why people donated to the Kickstarter. This information is valuable to be able to determine the best path for being able to reach the goal of the Kickstarter. Another great piece of information would be why people did not donate to the Kickstarter. If we could determine the cause of the reason people did not donate, we can try to change their way of thinking and receive a donation from them.

Another table we could have used to help make our data more precise is a box and whisker plot. This would allow us to examine the distribution of campaign goals and find any possible outliers in our data set. This would allow us to remove any data that is unlikely a realistic campaign, which could skew our analysis.
